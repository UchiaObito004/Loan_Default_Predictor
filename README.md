# Loan_Default_Predictor
This project presents a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for loan approval prediction, encompassing data ingestion, exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and deployment. The dataset is initially explored through EDA, followed by skewness correction using the Yeo–Johnson power transformation, outlier handling via the IQR method, categorical feature encoding, numerical feature scaling, and label encoding. A Random Forest Classifier is trained and further enhanced using Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization, leading to a significant improvement in model performance. The optimized model achieves an accuracy of approximately 97.6%, demonstrating strong predictive reliability. Model effectiveness is further validated using a ROC–AUC curve, which yields a high AUC value close to 1.0, indicating excellent class discrimination. The entire workflow is deployed through an interactive Streamlit application for seamless experimentation and real-time predictions, with Continuous Integration (CI) ensuring code robustness, reproducibility, and consistent updates throughout the development lifecycle.
